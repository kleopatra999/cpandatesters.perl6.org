Note: "clickable" usually means "click to filter for said value" here.

- [ ] make cells and headings in compiler/os/backend tables clickable
- [ ] add tag column to database table reports, and let the user edit it. In case it is numish and a issue tracker is mentioned in the distribution, display a link to the given ticket, otherwise display it as a clickable tag.
- [ ] make dist name in dist.tt clickable
- [ ] send daily/weekly mails to dist authors, and perhaps also mails to rakudo devs in case too much modules failed in the last days
- [ ] make the database tables available for download
- [ ] perhaps queue test reports that could not be sent but do not let panda die
- [ ] show maintainer besides/instead author on distribution page
- [ ] <timotimo> FROGGS: the name of the distribution is surprisingly small on a test results page
- [ ] <timotimo> and it'd be nice if you could reach the github repository website for the module from the test results page and maybe also the overview lists
- [ ] <timotimo> FROGGS: also, the tables really ought to be sortable and stuff
- [ ] consider *all* reports when generating stats for /recent, but only show one line per release and one line for all dev releases between two releases
