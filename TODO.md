Note: "clickable" usually means "click to filter for said value" here.

- [ ] make cells and headings in compiler/os/backend tables clickable
- [ ] collaps dev releases in compiler/os/backend tables to ⋮ ¹⁾, which would be clickable too and would show all dev releases between two releases
- [ ] implement /authors
- [ ] add tag column to database table reports, and let the user edit it. In case it is numish and a issue tracker is mentioned in the distribution, display a link to the given ticket, otherwise display it as a clickable tag.
- [ ] make dist name in dist.tt clickable
- [ ] precalc dist quality/graphs
- [ ] send daily/weekly mails to dist authors, and perhaps also mails to rakudo devs in case too much modules failed in the last days
- [ ] make the database tables available for download
- [ ] implement Etags to allow caching of css, js and fonts
- [ ] perhaps queue test reports that could not be sent but do not let panda die
